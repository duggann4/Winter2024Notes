- paper 1 grades good
- program is a thing
	- don't do early stopping
	- accuracy, not cross entropy - need to update this!
- final project: practical axperimentation

Performance metrics
- for humans to be able to tell whether a model is good
- comparing models
- types:
	- loss, but they're primarily designed for machines...
	- metrics are designed for human assessment
		- often computed periodically on dev in the training loop
		- can highlight certain desirable or undesirable model behaviors
		- better to use metrics for early stopping
		- TYPES!!!
			- confusion matrix - binary classification
				- columns are predictions
				- TN,FP\\\\FN,TP
				- accuracy: higher is better, $\frac{TP+TN}{N}$
				- error: $1-acc$
				- precision: $\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$
				- recall: $frac{TP}{TP+FN}$
