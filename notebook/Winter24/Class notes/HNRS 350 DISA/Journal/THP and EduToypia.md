# Podcast
Note: Instead of listening to the podcast, I opted to read through the transcript PDF. Also, I am really honing in on Elijah's story because it is remarkably close to a carbon-copy of my own.


- Flickering lights triggering epilepsy
	- denial of accommodations to avoid hospital trips
	- supposedly effecting the "standing" of the HS
> [!note]
> I can relate to this on multiple levels. I was in the STEM Magnet program at Mountlake Terrace HS, so I really resonate with Elijah's experience (more on that later). Furthermore, in my experience in CS courses at WWU, I definitely feel like there's a negative correlation (line goes down) between course level/number and professors' "sentiment" towards accommodations.

- Shitty 504 meetings and difficulty in implementation
	- grade/performance-oriented development
		- needing more support in classes you're struggling in; root problems are class-agnostic, should be treated as such
	- *Personal note:* In HS, I had every class every day, so this made implementing extended testing time challenging. Also: "You're not 2+ years behind in math, so you don't need an IEP, and we will put minimal effort into building your 504." This was in 10th grade (pre-ASD diagnosis) when I was struggling in my algebra 2 honors and chem classes but doing well in my Intro CS CiHS class.
- IB & reputation
	- How many disabled people do I know that went to EWHS (the IB school in my school district)? At the time: zero, currently: could count on one hand.

## Fast Facts
- **Self description:** "a library for Computer Science toys ... and other tangibles"
- **My high-level description:** A repository here at WWU in the SMATE library with loads of CS educational aids, activities, games, and other forms of physical/kinesthetic engagement
- **Disclosures:** EduTOYpia is run by Professor Caroline Hardin, who I took SCED 205 from in FA23 and thoroughly enjoyed. This path is also how I became aware of its existence.
- **Additional context:** While disability, accessibility, and accessible technology is not currently published information on EduTOYpia, my understanding from Dr. Hardin's class last quarter is that this is the scope of the repository's current work.

## Getting Involved
- Refer to "Disclosures" above for context of knowledge, but the lab is always looking for people to test/play with the resources and document their experience, especially in an accessibility/adaptation context!
- The library also is looking to expand its collection of adaptive tech for CS Ed. I know they have a [Code Jumper](https://codejumper.com), which is for the visually impaired, but that's all I know about
- To get involved, send Dr. Caroline Hardin an email and mention that Noah from SCED 205 sent you!
