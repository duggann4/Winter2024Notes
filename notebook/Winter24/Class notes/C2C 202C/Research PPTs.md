T1:
- 45% of schools are T1 (extent? Federal)
Current "debate":
- T1 mentoring is great!
- Continued mentoring into HS
- Not enough funding going to T1 schools, would need to increase T1 spending 5-8x
Absenteeism & achivement
- stat sig GPA increase
Teacher-student
- not enough to "close the gap"
- limited to the school scope - lacks "how are things at home?"
BBBSA:
- 2021 results promising
Thoughts:
- more opportunities
- strategic and targeted funding
- consistency and quality is key!
