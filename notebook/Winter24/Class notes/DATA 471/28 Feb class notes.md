# Genetic Algorithms
- see also: evolution
- an alternative to grad descent
- crossover, mutations
- population diversity
	- goal: Third Reich
	- Kristen's class has corrupted me with "everything is eugenics"...
- parts:
	- encoding schemes
	- fitness functions
		- survival of the fittest
	- selection techniques
		- breeding
	- crossover
		- "reproductive cells" - percent of genes that go into the zygote
	- mutation - the "getting better" bit
- when?
	- scheduling
	- avoiding local optimization
	- hyperparameter tuning
	- parallelization straightforward
- notebook demo!
	- cell run 113!?
- inbreeding?

# Simulated Annealing
- metal annealing
- approximating the global min
- state: one possible state of the problem
- temerature: probability of accepting a new state given the current state
	- reducing volatility over time
- rate at which the temperature decreases
- avoiding local minima: jumping via accepting worse states
- combinatorics-based optimization
- psuedo-$O(1)$, since number of steps is a hyperparameter
