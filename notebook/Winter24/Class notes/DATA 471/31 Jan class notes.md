- Q3 on Fri
- halfspaces
	- neural nets learn where to put the hyperplanes
- making predictions from the hidden representations
- "black box" vs "method to madness"
	- the whole is beyond
- minibatch: random sample of train set
- purely stochastic gradient decent: mb=1
- full-batch gradient decent: mb=ntrain
- epochs: full pass throughs of the training data
- mb size GPU-dependent
- number of epochs based on overfit scenarios
