# Advocacy Group Research
*Since the topic this week is more on the general side compared to future weeks, I am using this week to discuss a WWU thing that I don't think really fits well elsewhere.*

For this weeks disability discrimination organization, I looked into the NEAT (Next Generation Effective Affective Technology) research group in the Computer Science department here at Western. This group is co-founded and co-directed by Professor Shameem Ahmed (who is easily one of my top 3 CS profs), and focuses on "\[t\]echnology for neurodivergent individuals, HCI, and ICTD"([source](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~ahmeds/Research.html)). Refer to "source" for information about the current projects of the lab. Prof. Ahmed's publication portfolio is recently mainly centered around stress and anxiety in autistic college students and remedies thereof. 

There are multiple ways that this research group can be supported: not only through direct participation, but also participating in data collection efforts and other forms of input.

*__CONFLICT OF INTEREST NOTICE:__ In the interest of full disclosure, it is worth mentioning that I am currently in communication with Dr. Ahmed about participating in the NEAT lab's work, including consulting him on developing a topic for the research in this class. Furthermore, a handful of friends and acquantences are currently participating in the lab's work.*
