- Generalized xenophobia/othering rooted in eighteenth century (1700s)
	- Now, rational explanation needed; disability largely sidelined

Three great citizenship debates:
1. women's sufferage
2. African American freedom & civil rights
3. restriction of immigration

## Defining disability

- Disability often used as a scapegoat
	- In case of (1), deviations from male "norm"
- Often used as "ammo" by both sides of debate
>[!question]
>I'm having difficulty following how using disability as evidence *against* discrimination went...

Disability as heirarchical marker: We've been here before with gender!

Natural vs. monstrous $\to$ normal vs. monstrous; by late 19th / early 20th centuries

Complexities of the "normality" concept:
- social sciences
- statistics
- industrialization & interchangability
- establishing the universal and unquestionable concepts of good and right
- establishing social heirarchy & legitamacy, rights
- defining "normality" simultaneously and inherently defines "disability"

Modern sense of normality:
- mid-1800s (post-industrial revolution)
- pervasive belief in progress
- advent of evolution
- "the book of nature" & "God's plan"
- "naturality" $\implies$ conforming to intent/design on nature
- "normality" $\implies$ in the direction of human evolution; progress as a species
>[!question]
>Insert basis for eugenics here?

The other side of the coin:
- "natural" : "monstrous" as "normal" : "defective"
- $\mu =$ "normal"; "abnormal" only used in $-\sigma$ case
>[!question]
>The case of $+\sigma$?
- "abnormality" pulled humanity evolutionarily back; actively harmful

Intersectionalities of this notion:
- Western notion of "progress" not universal; implication of racism
	- Case study: Down's syndrome & Mongolism
	- End of 1800s: linguistic cleansing of ASL
- 1904 World's Fair: freak shows
	- intersection of disability and race on the ideology of evolutionary heirarchy
	- "defectives"/"primitives": both individuals and races
		- Heirarchy based on "teachability"/"trainability"
>[!note]-
>I think I've seen something about this in my "history of SPED" research for a paper I wrote. If I have my source dates right, this notion was pervasive into the 1970s. This was from a physical book somewhere in Western's library.
- mixed-race more defective than constituent "pure" forms
	- via aversion to inter-racial sex as a concept
- prescription ***and*** description

## Disability & Slavery

- deafness and blindness 3x and 2x more common among blacks in free states vs slave states
	- External factors, much?
- elopement a mental disease
>[!question]
>Dysaesthesia Aechiopis?

- 1860s: education of (free) African Americans at expense of lifespan
	- unnatural exertion
	- education worse than freedom(?)
- 1844 NY: Retort by showing issues with data quality and trying to increase the $R^2$.
	- slavery as protection from disability unchallenged

## Women's Sufferage
- ties back to evolution argument
- Echoes of Slavery 1844 NY retort: protection from the rigors of politics
>[!question]
>Seeds of ableist paternalism?
- *So many echoes to the slavery argument!*

Disability and the argument for sufferage:
- disability as justification for political inequality unchallenged
- dispute lies in the claim that women suffer from these "disabilities", subsequently existence thereof
	- disrupting the self-fulfilling prophecies

## Disability & Immigration policy
- 1907: law change denied entry to those who disability may interfere with ability to work/earn a living
	- prior: capable of self-care
- 1903: epilepsy (and similar) explicitly added to exclusion list
- 1917: "psychopathic inferiority", including homosexuals
- 1973: APA: homosexuality no longer a mental illness
- 1907: Western standard of "normal" implicated in denying various ethnic groups
- Insert invisible disabilities remark
	- abnormal appearance resulted in secondary screening, discovery of other conditions
	- echoes in medicine today!
- 1922: infertility used as denial reason via being made target of workplace humor/harassment
	- advertisement of their condition
>[!question]
>Seeds of systemic pride suppression?

## Implications today
- dissociation from negatively marked categories
>[!info]- Personal note: negative self-talk
> "You're not *that* autistic...", "Do you *really* need that assistive device?"
- distancing from those with more severe conditions
	- "Othering" in SPED!!!
- Seeking equality for one inherently seeks inequality for another
>[!question]
>Remedy?
